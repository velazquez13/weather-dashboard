# weather-dashboard

the purpose of this project is to create a weather outlook to plan trips accordingly.
The main goal of this project is to use server-side-apis

*i created a secondary github to clean up my work and create a nicer protfolio but this caused issues with committing as it would not do so through my velazquez13. i am aware of needed to submit my own repository with my work but i hope this screen shot proves i myself did the work.
